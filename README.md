RaceAgainstTheRabbit
====================

The rabbit is racing against the turtle.
The distance to win the race is only 1 mile.
The rabbit can travel 4 miles while the turtle can only travel 1 mile in a given period.
But the speed is not the only factor determining the winner here because the focus also plays the role. In this race, by setting the rabbit's focus property to be 0, that means the rabbit will never actually go the distance. Where as setting the turtle's focus property to be 10, meaning that 10 out of 10 times, the turtle will travel 1 mile. So the turtle always win.
By increasing the focus property of each animal, it will make it more likely for that animal to win. An increase in 1 unit of focus has more effect on the rabbit because of the higher speed property.
